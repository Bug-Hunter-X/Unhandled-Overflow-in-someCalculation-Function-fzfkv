This repository contains a MATLAB function that demonstrates an uncommon error: an overflow caused by an unchecked exponent calculation. The `someCalculation` function raises an overflow error when it receives large input values.  The solution addresses this by implementing input validation and alternative calculation techniques to prevent the overflow.  The `bug.m` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version.
